  description: |
    Create tournaments on Lidraughts that are externally managed. Lidraughts generates a tournament lobby with upcoming / ongoing games, results and standings. You have full control over the participants and pairings through the API.

    An optional feature is to display FMJD data of the players (photo, real name, rating, title, etc) in the tournament lobby. This data is taken from the most recently published rating list as on [fmjd.org/?p=rating](https://www.fmjd.org/?p=rating).
    Only use this feature when it makes sense in the context of your tournament, and when you are sure the Lidraughts account matches the FMJD ID!

        This API is very fast and cheap on lidraughts side.
        So you can call it quite often (like once every 5 seconds).

        Use it to track players and know when they're connected on lidraughts and playing games.

        Invite a user to play in your tournament. Only invite users if you know they want to participate. Users don't receive a notification when invited.

        If an FMJD ID is specified, there will be an extra section in the player details in the tournament lobby, that shows the public [FMJD profile](https://www.fmjd.org/?p=pcard&id=10122) information such as photo, full name, rating, etc.
        When the tournament has `userDisplay` set to `fmjd`, the same information will be visible in the tournament lobby instead of the Lidraughts username, rating and title.

        When an invited player opens the tournament lobby, they will see a prompt that asks if they agree to join. It contains an explanation of the tournament rules, and their FMJD ID if you specified one.
